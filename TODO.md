## TODOs, vaguely sorted by priority

- Opening multiple selected files
- Allow opening images with 'feh', fix it not breaking fen
- Show folders first in filespanes
- Better scrolling
- Commands like :mkdir etc.
- Don't show "empty" twice on the right, aka when fen.sel is a file
- Disallow recursive copies or whatever
- Add an underscore for duplicate pasting (maybe a modal question for overwrite/new name?)
- Copying from the terminal is annoying because of tview somehow
- (Maybe...) Vim/ranger stuff like `5<space>` selecting 5 files, or `5j` going down 5
- Remove being able to delete while mid and right pane are empty? (Going into an empty folder (mid and right pane are empty), then deleting it will set selected entry on the left pane to 0 instead of matching the GoDown() when deleting in middlePane)
- 'n' is a little too close to 'M', maybe change it?
- Fix `history_test.go` for Windows paths
- Fix green color for all executables (the current bitmask check doesn't work for everything)
- Fix invisibility near root dir
- Caching stuff (maybe only re-dirlist for left/right)
- Util function for getting folder/file size string (sensible file size strings like 8.2M, 40B, 1.2G)
- Custom themes by changing `tview.Styles`
- Maybe do dimming of colors with the dim text styling in tview where its like `"[dim:]"` or something
- Different colors in modals
- `H` and `L` controls feel weird because the screen scrolls in a specific way instead of just setting the cursor to the bottom of the screen like the behaviour in vim
- Jump to file/folder created on n/N
